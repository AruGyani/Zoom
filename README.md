# Zoom Bot 

Hi! This bot was designed for the UTD Class of 2024 Discord Server. Its main purposes are for greeting new users and administrative commands, however it has scalable functionality for many different uses.


# Setup
In order to run this bot, you must have both `node.js` installed.

**First**, make a folder to house the code for the bot. Within this folder, open a command prompt and run the following initialization command: `npm init`. This will take you through a series of properties, answer these as you choose or leave them blank, it is entirely preferential. This should make a new file called `package.json`.

Now, install `discord.js` within this folder. 
Run the following. `npm install discord.js`

Next, make another folder within the current one, titled, `commands`. Within this you will download the `js` various command files or make your own custom files within.

Download all other remaining files into the main folder. Run the bot using `node .` or `node index.js` in a command prompt within your bot folder.
